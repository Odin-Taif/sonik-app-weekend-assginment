## Presentation Video Requirements

To complete the project, create a video presentation that showcases the functionality and code behind your work. Publish the video on YouTube, and make sure the presentation includes the following segments:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce yourself.
2. **Project Overview**: Describe what you built.
3. **Big Picture Plan**: Explain the overarching goals of the project.
4. **Project Board**: Show your project board and outline your workflow and approach.
5. **Application Run**: Demonstrate that the application can be run successfully.
6. **Test Cases**: Show and execute test cases to validate the application's functionality.
7. **Code Explanation**: Highlight specific pieces of code that meet the project requirements. Clearly explain which part of the requirement each piece of code fulfills.

**Recording Tips**:

- Ensure the audio is clear enough to be understood in an office setting.
- The video content should be visible and large enough for mobile viewing.
- Tools like OBS can help you combine screen sharing with video of yourself for a professional look.

## Notes

- You will be evaluated based on the content and clarity of the video.
- Address each project requirement clearly in your presentation to make it easy to assess.
